# My React App

## Overview

This is a React application developed as a learning project to explore **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for testing React components. The app allows users to search for stories from the Hacker News API, demonstrating how to implement features and write tests for them.

## Features

- User authentication simulation
- Search functionality for Hacker News stories
- Display of fetched stories with links
- Error handling for API requests
- Comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.
- **Vitest**: A fast unit test framework for Vite projects.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components in a user-centric way.
